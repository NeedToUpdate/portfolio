# Animation and Interaction

## Scope
The animation, interaction, and visual effect utilities used to create an engaging portfolio experience.

## Key Artifacts
- `components/utils/onHoverHook.tsx` - Custom hook for hover effects
- `components/utils/onScrollHook.tsx` - Custom hook for scroll-based animations
- `components/utils/useOutsideClick.ts` - Hook for detecting clicks outside elements
- `components/utils/Particle.ts` - Particle class for particle animations
- `components/utils/Vector.ts` - Vector mathematics for animations
- `components/utils/Quad.ts` - Quadrilateral shape handling
- `components/dynamicBackground.tsx` - Dynamic animated background
- `components/particleBackground.tsx` - Particle animation background
- `components/gradientBackground.tsx` - Gradient background effects
- `components/typedText.tsx` - Animated typing text effect

## Observations
The portfolio includes several specialized utilities for creating interactive animations and visual effects:

1. **Custom React Hooks**
   - Hover detection for UI elements
   - Scroll-based animations for page sections
   - Outside click detection for dropdowns/modals

2. **Animation Engine Components**
   - Vector mathematics for smooth animations
   - Particle system for creating space/cosmic themed effects
   - Shape handling for more complex visual elements

3. **Background Effects**
   - Multiple background options that likely create a space/cosmic theme
   - Dynamic backgrounds that potentially respond to user interaction
   - Particles that might simulate stars or cosmic dust

4. **Text Animations**
   - Typed text effect for dynamic content presentation

These interaction patterns create a modern, engaging user experience that enhances the portfolio content. The combination of particle effects, animations, and responsive interactions suggests a portfolio that prioritizes impressive visual presentation alongside content.
