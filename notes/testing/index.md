# Testing Framework

## Scope
The testing strategy and implementation for ensuring code quality in the portfolio website.

## Key Artifacts
- `jest.config.js` - Jest configuration
- `jest.setup.js` - Jest setup file for configurations
- `tests/_document.test.tsx` - Tests for document structure
- `tests/components/projectBlurb.test.tsx` - Component tests
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` - CI workflow for running tests

## Observations
The portfolio employs a testing framework based on Jest and React Testing Library:

1. **Testing Configuration**
   - Jest is configured as the primary testing framework
   - Custom configuration in jest.config.js for handling Next.js components
   - Setup file extends Jest with additional capabilities from Testing Library

2. **Component Testing**
   - React Testing Library is used to test React components
   - Tests verify both visual presentation and component behavior
   - Mocks are used for Next.js specific features like Head component

3. **Document Structure Testing**
   - Tests ensure proper HTML document structure
   - Verifies that core elements like title are correctly set

4. **Continuous Integration**
   - Tests are automatically run via GitHub Actions
   - Part of the CI/CD pipeline to prevent deployment of broken code

While the test coverage appears to be focused on key components rather than comprehensive, the essential infrastructure is in place to support broader test coverage as needed.
