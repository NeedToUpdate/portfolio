A self-service reporting and analytics platform, allowing the company to run on-demand reports with Tableau. This system included:

- **Tableau Deployment**: Hosted on AWS EC2 behind a load balancer in a private VPC, passing strenuous security checks.
- **Direct Data Warehouse Integration**: Connected to Redshift data marts, enabling real-time insights.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensured secure and restricted access.

This system eliminated manual report generation, empowering business teams with real-time data visibility.
