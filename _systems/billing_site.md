A self-service billing system built to integrate Moneris with a major insurance provider. The goal was to eliminate reliance on call centers for billing updates and make the process seamless for users.

- **Moneris Integration**: Allowed secure credit card and payment updates, with full PCI compliace.
- **AWS Serverless Architecture**: Fully event-driven for cost efficiency and scalability.
- **Improved User Experience**: Allowed members to update billing details without needing support calls.

By eliminating the need for manual billing changes, this system reduced operational overhead and significantly improved customer experience.
