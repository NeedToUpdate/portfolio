This system was built to **integrate a major client** into the existing infrastructure, covering:

- **Enrollment Processing**: Fully automated onboarding and **real-time data validation**.

- **Payment Processing**: Seamless integration with existing **billing & claims workflows**.

Thanks to this architecture, multiple clients were **onboarded faster**, leading to **substantial revenue increases**.
