The business was evaluating another SaaS product to plug a gap in their integration layer. I designed a microservices-based alternative and made the case to the business to build it in-house instead.

The argument came down to long-term cost, control, and the fact that off-the-shelf tools would not fit the business. It went up to the board. They approved it. A dedicated engineering team was assembled to build it.
