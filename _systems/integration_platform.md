The business was evaluating a SaaS product to fill a gap in the integration layer. I proposed something larger: a unified compute architecture. One language across the stack, containerized, cloud-native, and fully automated through IaC. Homogenous by design, so observability, security, and operations could all run from a single layer.

I led the internal effort and built the case across the organization. They approved it and assembled a dedicated team to deliver it.
