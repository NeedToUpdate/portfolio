We revamped payment integrations across multiple enterprise systems, designing a flexible, scalable, and auditable framework. Unlike traditional integrations, we took a start-to-finish approach, ensuring every transaction was automatically reconciled at both the source and target systems.

- **End-to-End Payment Flow**: Tracked every transaction from initiation to settlement, ensuring full visibility.
- **Flexible Integration Framework**: Designed to easily accommodate new payment providers and processing rules.
- **Automated Reconciliation**: Built an auto-reconciliation process, cross-checking payment extracts between all systems.
- **Scalability & Compliance**: Architected with serverless AWS technologies, ensuring high availability, audit logs, and compliance with financial standards.

This system eliminated manual reconciliation efforts, reduced errors, and ensured that every dollar processed was accounted for across the enterprise.
