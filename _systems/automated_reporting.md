Monthly close at a regulated financial institution meant weeks of manual effort, no audit trail, and no visibility into whether the underlying data had changed.

We built a reporting engine that generates reports on demand, detects stale or inconsistent data automatically, and logs every modification including post-close changes. Reporting that took a month now takes minutes.
