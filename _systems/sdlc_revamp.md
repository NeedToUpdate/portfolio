The platform had been built and maintained by a small internal team. No branching strategy, manual deployments, no clear path from bug to production. We came in to change that.

We automated the entire deployment pipeline on Azure Pipelines, introduced a structured branching strategy, and gave the team the processes they needed to actually run well. On the product side, we cleaned up the codebase, rebuilt the frontend to be mobile-first, and made it scalable enough to package as a native app using Capacitor. The web and mobile experience now share a single codebase. Time from bug identification to fix in production went from a week to four hours.
