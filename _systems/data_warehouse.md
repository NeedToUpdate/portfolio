- **Validation Engine**: A flexible validation system that allowed business users to modify data rules dynamically.
- **SQL-Based ETL Engine**: Optimized for AWS Redshift, allowing rapid data mart generation.
- **Data Quarantine & Automated Fixes**: Implemented a quarantine process for bad data, enabling automated correction workflows.
- **Data Quality & Governance**: Established a quality and validation framework, integrated stale data detection, and implemented enhanced PII protection.
- **Faster Insights**: Reduced data request time from weeks to a day.

This system transformed the companyâ€™s ability to deliver data on-demand, drastically improving efficiency, transparency, and allowed data-driven decisions.
