title: "Architecting Systems That Actually Run Your Business"
sentence: I design the architecture and lead the team. I'm in from the first whiteboard session through production. What ships has to work under load, under scrutiny, and over time. I've sat in enough executive briefings and engineering reviews to align the business from top to bottom.
description: A selection of real projects I led. The details are confidential, but I can walk you through the technical decisions in a conversation. Feel free to reach out!

**Ownership** – I find where the breakdown is — strategy, process, or code — and fix it.  
**Scale** – I build for where the business is going, not where it is.  
**Security** – I design security from an attacker's point of view.  
**Automation** – I build systems that replace entire manual workflows, not just individual tasks.  
**Alignment** – I make sure what engineering builds is what the business asked for.
